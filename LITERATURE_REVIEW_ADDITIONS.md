This file documents the new papers and bit flips identified during the CS197 literature review enhancement process.

## New Papers Added to paper.jsonl

1. **ACORD: An Expert-Annotated Retrieval Dataset for Legal Contract Drafting** (Wang et al., 2025)
2. **What to Read in a Contract? Party-Specific Summarization** (Sancheti et al., 2023)

4. **Automatic Legal Writing Evaluation of LLMs** (Pires, 2025)

## New Bit Flips Added to bit_flip.jsonl

1. **Consumer Focus Flip**: Legal AI should focus on consumer comprehension vs professional legal reasoning
2. **Evaluation Criteria Flip**: Evaluation should prioritize accessibility vs legal accuracy
3. **Expert Annotation Purpose Flip**: Expert annotation should identify consumer needs vs professional knowledge
4. **Document Analysis Purpose Flip**: Analysis should prioritize explanation vs technical extraction
5. **Scalability Priority Flip**: Scale to serve millions of consumers vs efficient professional work

## Integration Status

- ✅ Enhanced section_notes/02-lit-review.md with comprehensive new analysis
- ✅ Created detailed CS197 analysis files in related_work/
- ✅ Prepared JSONL additions (files created: paper_additions.jsonl, bit_flip_additions.jsonl)
- ⏳ JSONL files need to be integrated (LFS limitation prevents direct appending)

## Note for Future Integration

The paper_additions.jsonl and bit_flip_additions.jsonl files contain properly formatted entries that should be appended to the main JSONL files when LFS access is available.
