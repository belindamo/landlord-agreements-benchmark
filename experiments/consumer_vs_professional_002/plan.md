# Experiment Plan: Consumer Comprehension vs. Professional Analysis

## Experiment Idea
### Title
Consumer Comprehension vs. Professional Analysis for Legal AI

### Bit (Problem)
Legal AI systems are typically designed for professional legal analysis (technical extraction, clause identification, legal reasoning), but most legal AI consumers are laypeople who need comprehension assistance, not professional-level analysis.

### Flip (Solution)
AI systems optimized for consumer comprehension (plain language summaries, scenario-based Q&A, contextual explanations) will provide superior real-world utility compared to systems optimized for professional legal analysis.

### Hypothesis
Consumer-focused AI will demonstrate statistically significant improvements (≥30% comprehension increase, ≥50% better decision-making, ≥40% reduced time-to-understanding) compared to professional-focused AI across diverse participants.

## Evaluation Plan
### Metrics
- Primary metric: Comprehension accuracy score (0-100)
- Secondary metrics:
  - Decision-making quality score (scenario responses)
  - Time to complete understanding tasks (minutes)
  - Confidence ratings (1-10 scale)
  - Preference scores (qualitative + quantitative)

### Baseline
- Professional-focused AI: Technical legal analysis, clause extraction, legal terminology
- Document-only condition: Raw lease document without AI assistance

### Data Collection
1. Sample 3 lease documents (simple/medium/complex complexity)
2. Generate AI outputs for each document:
   - Consumer-focused: Plain language summaries, scenario-based Q&A
   - Professional-focused: Technical analysis, clause extraction
3. Recruit 30 participants across expertise levels (10 layperson/10 some experience/10 legal background)
4. Cross-over design: each participant experiences both conditions
5. Measure comprehension, decision-making, time, and preferences

### Analysis Method
- Mixed-effects ANOVA for comprehension and decision-making scores
- Paired t-tests for within-subject comparisons
- Effect size calculations (Cohen's d)
- Qualitative coding of participant feedback
- Time-series analysis of task completion

### Success Criteria
- Consumer-focused approach shows ≥30% improvement in comprehension (p < 0.05)
- Decision-making quality improves by ≥50% (effect size ≥ 0.5)
- Time-to-understanding reduces by ≥40%
- ≥80% of participants prefer consumer-focused approach

## Implications
### If Successful
- Validates core bit flip: consumer focus > professional focus for real users
- Establishes new standard for legal AI design priorities
- Provides evidence for accessibility-first legal technology development
- Enables scaling to larger legal AI applications

### If Failed
- Suggests professional analysis provides sufficient consumer value
- May indicate need for hybrid approaches (professional + consumer elements)
- Could highlight importance of user training vs. system design
- Would require re-evaluation of core research assumption

### Future Work
- Scale to larger participant pools and document diversity
- Test in real-world deployment contexts
- Develop personalized AI approaches based on user expertise
- Explore optimal balance of consumer vs. professional elements

## Related Works
### Nearest Neighbor Paper
Plain language contract research (Manor et al., 2019) and legal accessibility studies

### Key Differences
- First direct comparison of AI system design philosophies for legal comprehension
- Focus on real decision-making outcomes vs. just comprehension metrics
- Cross-expertise evaluation rather than single user type

### Literature Gap
No existing work directly compares consumer-focused vs. professional-focused AI system design for legal comprehension tasks

## Vectors (Risk Dimensions)
### Technical Risk
- AI output quality differences between approaches
- Consistency across document complexity levels
- Participant recruitment and retention

### Methodological Risk
- Learning effects in cross-over design
- Selection bias in participant recruitment
- Measurement validity for comprehension tasks

### Resource Risk
- Participant compensation costs (~$750 for 30 participants)
- Time constraints for data collection
- Access to diverse legal documents

### Priority
**10/10** - This is the core experiment that directly tests our central bit flip assumption about consumer vs. professional focus in legal AI.
