## Summary

TermSight introduces an intelligent reading interface that makes Terms of Service (ToS) more approachable through visual summaries, categorization, and contextualized definitions.

## CS197 Analysis

### Problem
Terms of Service are ubiquitous, legally binding contracts that govern digital interactions, but they're filled with complex legal terminology that burdens users. ToS are not designed to be read by consumers.

### Prior Assumptions
- Making legal documents accessible requires only text simplification
- Users can effectively navigate legal documents with minimal assistance
- Plain language conversion alone solves legal document accessibility

### Insight
AI-powered reading interfaces with multi-modal features (visual summaries, categorization, contextualized definitions) can significantly improve legal document accessibility and user engagement.

### Technical Approach
- **Visual Summaries**: Highlight relevance and power balance of information
- **Categorization**: Organize content into concise plain-language summaries
- **Contextualized Definitions**: Provide explanations and scenarios for unfamiliar phrases
- **Multi-Modal Interface**: Combines text, visual, and interactive elements
- **User-Centered Design**: Designed specifically for consumer comprehension

### Evaluation
- Within-subjects study (N=20) measuring reading difficulty and willingness to read ToS
- Significant reduction in reading difficulty
- Increased participant willingness to engage with legal documents
- Observation of diverse user strategies when interacting with AI features

### Impact
- Demonstrates measurable improvements in legal document accessibility
- Shows promise of multi-modal interfaces for legal AI
- Validates user-centered approach to legal document design
- Provides framework for consumer-focused legal AI systems

## Relevance to Our Work

TermSight provides important design principles for consumer-focused legal AI:

1. **Multi-Modal Approach**: Shows value of visual and interactive elements beyond text
2. **User Evaluation**: Demonstrates importance of measuring actual user comprehension
3. **Consumer Focus**: Validates targeting end users rather than legal professionals
4. **Accessibility Design**: Provides framework for making legal documents approachable

## Key Insights for Literature Review

- **Interface Design**: Legal AI benefits from thoughtful user interface design
- **Multi-Modal Features**: Visual summaries and categorization improve comprehension
- **User Engagement**: Proper design increases willingness to engage with legal documents
- **Consumer Validation**: Empirical validation crucial for consumer-facing legal AI

## Application to Our Benchmark

Our work builds on TermSight's insights by:
- Focusing on rental agreements as high-impact consumer documents
- Incorporating multi-modal considerations in evaluation design
- Emphasizing consumer comprehension over technical performance
- Validating that specialized approaches needed for consumer legal AI

## Gaps TermSight Addresses

- Moves beyond text-only legal AI to multi-modal interfaces
- Provides empirical validation of consumer understanding
- Shows design principles for legal document accessibility
- Demonstrates measurable improvements in user engagement
