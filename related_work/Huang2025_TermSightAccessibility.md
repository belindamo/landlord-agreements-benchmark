## CS197 Analysis

### Problem
Terms of Service (ToS) are ubiquitous, legally binding contracts that govern consumers' digital interactions. However, ToS are not designed to be read: they are filled with pages of ambiguous and complex legal terminology that burden potential users, creating a significant barrier to informed consent.

### Prior Assumptions
- Legal documents can be made accessible through simple text simplification
- Consumer legal comprehension is primarily a reading difficulty problem
- Static document formats are sufficient for legal information consumption
- Legal accessibility is about content rather than interaction design

### Key Insight
Legal document accessibility requires **intelligent reading interfaces** that combine visual summaries, plain language categorization, and contextualized explanations. The problem is not just linguistic complexity but also information architecture and user interaction design.

### Technical Approach
**TermSight System Components:**
1. **Visual summaries** highlighting relevance and power balance of information
2. **Categorization and simplification** into concise plain-language summaries  
3. **Contextualized definitions** and scenarios for unfamiliar phrases
4. **Interactive interface** for guided legal document navigation

### Evaluation
**Within-subjects evaluation (N=20):**
- **Significantly reduced difficulty** of reading ToS
- **Increased participants' willingness** to read legal documents
- **Emerging interaction strategies** showing diverse ways users engaged with AI-powered features
- Measurable improvements in user comprehension and engagement

### Impact
- Demonstrates effectiveness of AI-powered reading interfaces for legal accessibility
- Shows measurable improvements in user willingness to engage with legal documents
- Validates user-centered design approach for legal document comprehension
- Provides practical framework for consumer-focused legal AI

### Relevance to Our Work
- **Highly Relevant**: Directly validates our consumer-focused approach to legal document accessibility
- Demonstrates effectiveness of plain language summarization and categorization
- Shows importance of user-centered evaluation in legal AI
- Validates combination of AI techniques with interface design for legal comprehension
- Provides evidence for measurable improvements in user engagement with legal documents

### Assumptions Challenged
- **Bit Flip**: Challenges assumption that legal document accessibility is primarily about text simplification by demonstrating that effective legal comprehension requires intelligent interaction design combining visual summaries, categorization, and contextualized explanations tailored to user needs
