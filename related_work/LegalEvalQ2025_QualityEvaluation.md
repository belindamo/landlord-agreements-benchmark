## CS197 Analysis

### Problem
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in legal applications, current evaluation benchmarks focus mainly on factual accuracy while largely neglecting important linguistic quality aspects such as clarity, coherence, and terminology that are crucial for legal practice.

### Prior Assumptions
- Legal AI evaluation is primarily about factual accuracy
- Technical correctness is sufficient for legal AI assessment
- General text quality metrics work for legal domain evaluation
- Scaling model parameters automatically improves legal text quality

### Key Insight
Legal AI evaluation must assess **linguistic quality dimensions** (clarity, coherence, terminology) alongside factual accuracy. Legal text quality has distinct characteristics that require specialized evaluation approaches, and model scaling shows diminishing returns on quality after 14 billion parameters.

### Technical Approach
- **Regression model** for legal text quality evaluation based on:
  - Clarity
  - Coherence 
  - Terminology appropriateness
- **Specialized legal question set** for evaluation
- **Comprehensive analysis** of 49 LLMs across different scales and architectures
- **Pareto analysis** for cost-performance trade-offs

### Evaluation
Key findings from 49 LLM analysis:
1. **Model quality levels off at 14 billion parameters** (only 2.7% improvement at 72B)
2. **Engineering choices** (quantization, context length) have negligible impact
3. **Reasoning models consistently outperform base architectures**
4. **Qwen3 series optimal** for cost-performance trade-offs

### Impact
- Establishes standardized evaluation protocols for legal LLMs
- Reveals fundamental limitations in current training approaches
- Provides practical guidance for legal AI model selection
- Demonstrates importance of quality beyond accuracy in legal applications

### Relevance to Our Work
- **Critical for evaluation methodology**: Validates need for quality assessment beyond accuracy
- Provides framework for evaluating legal text clarity and coherence
- Relevant for our plain language summarization evaluation
- Demonstrates importance of specialized legal evaluation metrics
- Supports our focus on consumer comprehension quality

### Assumptions Challenged
- **Bit Flip**: Challenges assumption that legal AI evaluation is primarily about technical accuracy by demonstrating the critical importance of linguistic quality dimensions (clarity, coherence, terminology) that determine real-world usability in legal contexts
