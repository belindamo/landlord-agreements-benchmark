## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
- **What problem is being solved**: Automating legal contract review for lease agreements, specifically extracting entities and identifying "red flags" (potentially problematic clauses)
- **Why it matters**: Contract review is time-consuming, costly, and repetitive. Lease agreements have received little attention in legal information extraction literature despite being crucial for tenant-landlord relationships

### Assumption in Prior Work
- **Key assumption**: Legal information extraction focused primarily on other contract types (not lease agreements)
- **Inadequacy**: Lease agreements have unique characteristics and red flags that differ from general contracts
- **Gap**: Lack of specialized datasets and models for lease agreement analysis

### Insight
- **Novel contribution**: First specialized benchmark dataset for lease agreement review with expert annotations
- **Key insight**: Two-pronged approach combining entity extraction AND red flag detection for comprehensive contract review
- **Innovation**: ALeaseBERT - domain-specific language model pre-trained on lease agreements

### Technical Overview
- **Dataset**: 179 manually annotated lease agreement documents
- **Annotation types**: Entities (parties, dates, amounts, rights/obligations) + Red flags (dangerous/problematic clauses)
- **Model**: ALeaseBERT - BERT fine-tuned specifically for lease agreement elements
- **Approach**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) style tagging for both entities and red flags

### Proof/Evaluation
- **Method**: Expert annotation validation, baseline performance metrics
- **Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score for entity extraction and red flag detection
- **Validation**: Manual annotation by legal experts, inter-annotator agreement
- **Baseline**: Provides initial performance benchmarks for future research

### Impact
- **Field implications**: Establishes lease agreement analysis as distinct NLP research area
- **Practical impact**: Enables automated screening of lease agreements to identify problematic clauses
- **Research impact**: Provides first specialized dataset and baseline for lease agreement NLP research
- **Limitations**: Dataset size (179 documents) is relatively small for modern deep learning approaches

## Key Assumptions Identified
1. **Lease agreements require specialized analysis** (vs. general contract analysis)
2. **Red flag detection is as important as entity extraction** for contract review
3. **Domain-specific pre-training improves performance** over general models
4. **Manual expert annotation is necessary** for high-quality training data

## Relevance to Our Work
**Direct relevance**: This is the closest prior work to our landlord-tenant benchmark
- Similar domain (lease agreements)
- Similar goal (automated contract analysis)
- Provides red flag detection methodology
- Demonstrates need for specialized legal benchmarks

**Key differences from our approach**:
- Focuses on entity extraction + red flags vs. our plain language summarization + Q&A
- Smaller dataset (179 vs. our planned 100+)
- Technical extraction vs. comprehension evaluation
- Does not include LLM-as-judge evaluation framework

## Potential Bit Flips
1. **Current assumption**: Contract analysis should focus on technical extraction tasks
   **Potential flip**: Focus on comprehension and explanation tasks for end-user utility
2. **Current assumption**: Automated tools should replace human review
   **Potential flip**: Tools should augment human understanding rather than replace review
