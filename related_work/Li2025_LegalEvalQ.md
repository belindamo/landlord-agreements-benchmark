## CS197 Analysis Structure

### Problem
- **Core Issue**: Current legal AI evaluation focuses on factual accuracy while neglecting linguistic quality
- **Specific Gap**: Important quality aspects like clarity, coherence, and terminology are largely ignored
- **Real-world Need**: As LLMs are increasingly used in legal applications, quality evaluation beyond accuracy is essential

### Prior Work Assumptions
- Previous legal benchmarks assumed factual accuracy was the primary metric for legal text evaluation
- General language quality metrics were considered sufficient for legal domain
- Model scaling would uniformly improve all aspects of legal text generation

### Key Insight/Innovation
- **Quality Framework**: Systematic evaluation based on three dimensions:
  - **Clarity** - how understandable the text is
  - **Coherence** - how well-structured and logical the text is  
  - **Terminology** - appropriate use of legal language
- **Regression Model**: Develops automated quality assessment model for these dimensions
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Evaluates 49 different LLMs using this framework

### Technical Approach
1. **Quality Model Development**: Regression model for evaluating clarity, coherence, terminology
2. **Legal Question Set**: Specialized set of legal questions for evaluation
3. **Multi-Model Analysis**: Systematic evaluation across 49 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Rigorous statistical significance testing (p > 0.016)

### Evaluation/Proof
- **Scale**: 49 LLMs evaluated across multiple dimensions
- **Statistical Rigor**: Significance thresholds and Pareto analysis
- **Key Findings**:
  - Model quality plateaus at 14B parameters (only 2.7% improvement at 72B)
  - Engineering choices (quantization, context length) have negligible impact
  - Reasoning models consistently outperform base architectures
- **Practical Output**: Ranking list and cost-performance analysis

### Impact and Relevance
- **Benchmark Contribution**: First comprehensive quality-focused legal text evaluation
- **Methodological Innovation**: Multi-dimensional quality assessment framework for legal domain
- **Practical Insights**: Cost-performance analysis guides model selection
- **Research Infrastructure**: Open-source evaluation framework and model rankings

### Connection to Our Work
- **Quality Focus**: Aligns with our emphasis on plain language quality and clarity for consumer comprehension
- **Multi-dimensional Evaluation**: Supports our approach of evaluating multiple aspects (accuracy + accessibility)
- **LLM Assessment**: Validates systematic evaluation of LLM performance on legal tasks
- **Clarity Emphasis**: Directly relevant to our plain language summarization goals

### Assumptions Made
- Quality can be meaningfully decomposed into clarity, coherence, and terminology
- Regression models can accurately capture expert quality judgments
- Legal text quality requirements are distinct from general domain requirements
- Model scaling patterns in legal domain follow predictable trends

### Research Gap Addressed
- Lack of quality-focused evaluation in legal AI benchmarking
- Need for systematic comparison of legal text generation capabilities across models
- Absence of cost-performance analysis for legal AI applications

### Implications for Legal AI
- **Quality-First Approach**: Shifts focus from pure accuracy to holistic text quality
- **Model Selection Guidance**: Provides evidence-based recommendations for legal AI applications
- **Scaling Insights**: Reveals diminishing returns of larger models for legal text quality
- **Engineering Validation**: Shows minimal impact of common optimization techniques

### Methodological Contributions
- **Evaluation Framework**: Systematic approach for assessing legal text quality
- **Statistical Rigor**: Comprehensive statistical analysis with significance testing
- **Comparative Analysis**: Large-scale model comparison with practical implications
