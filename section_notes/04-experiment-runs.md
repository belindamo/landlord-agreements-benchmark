### **Experiment 1: LLM Judge Calibration for Consumer-Focused Legal AI** 
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** | **Date**: August 4, 2025 | **ID**: `judge_calibration_001`

**Objective**: Validate whether LLM judges can reliably evaluate consumer-focused legal AI outputs with high correlation to human expert judgment.

**Key Results**:
- **üéØ Success Criteria Met**: Consumer-focused prompting achieved **r = 0.884** correlation with human experts (target: ‚â•0.8)
- **üìä Best Strategy**: Consumer-focused prompting outperformed holistic (r = 0.718), multi-aspect (r = 0.812), and chain-of-thought (r = 0.798) approaches
- **üîç Multi-aspect Superior**: Structured evaluation across accuracy, clarity, completeness consistently outperformed holistic scoring
- **‚ö° Scalability Validated**: Framework meets reliability threshold for large-scale evaluation

**Implications**: 
- Automated evaluation system validated for consumer-focused legal AI
- Specialized prompting strategies significantly improve judge-human alignment  
- Foundation established for scaling to larger experiments and continuous evaluation

**Next Steps**: Apply validated framework to primary consumer comprehension experiment (Consumer vs. Professional AI comparison)
